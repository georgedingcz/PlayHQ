# Developing Checkers

## Project Description

I made a website that tracks games that are currently having deals across various gaming platforms.

## Deployment

The website is deployed on [Vercel](https://play-hq.vercel.app/) and the files are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/soursorbet/PlayHQ).

## Technologies & Tools Used

- REACT.js
- CSS
- API source (https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/)

## Timeframe

- ~A week

## Approach to Development

The project was broken down into these stages:

1. Search and test API (1-2 days)
2. Building the site (2-3 days)
3. Adding features and resolving bugs (1-2 days)
4. Styling (1 day)

## Future Developments and Improvements

1. Using other APIs to provide more details to the games listed (eg. game descriptions)
2. Using airtable to add 'buy' feature
3. Adding login feature so that users can save/keep track of specific games
